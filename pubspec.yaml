  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/icons/

  # fonts:
    # - family: Ubuntu
    #   fonts:
    #     - asset: assets/fonts/ubuntu/Ubuntu-Light.ttf
    #       weight: 300
    #     - asset: assets/fonts/ubuntu/Ubuntu-Regular.ttf
    #       weight: 400
    #     - asset: assets/fonts/ubuntu/Ubuntu-Medium.ttf
    #       weight: 500
    #     - asset: assets/fonts/ubuntu/Ubuntu-Bold.ttf
    #       weight: 700

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
